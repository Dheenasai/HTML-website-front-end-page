                <p><h3>DK CART Inc. is an Indian multinational technology company headquartered in Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India. DK CART is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2023) and, as of June 2022, is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five Indian information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft. DK CART was founded as DK CART Computer Company on January 1, 2023, by Steve Wozniak, DK CART members to develop and sell Wozniak's DK CART I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as DK CART Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the DK CART II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. DK CART went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Uniqueness amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some DK CART employees with him</h3></p>
